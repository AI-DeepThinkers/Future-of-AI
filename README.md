## Overview

This project demonstrates how AI can both empower and endanger critical domains like **medicine** and **climate change mitigation**. Through a case study in cancer genomics and a visionary climate defense system, we examine the responsible development of AI for societal good.

## Part 2 - Task 3: Ethics in Personalized Medicine

### Objective

Evaluate potential biases in AI-based treatment recommendations using the **Cancer Genomic Atlas** and propose fairness strategies to ensure equitable healthcare delivery.

### Bias Analysis

- **Underrepresentation of ethnic groups:** Leads to biased model predictions for minority populations.
- **Sample/class imbalance:** AI may prioritize common cancer types, ignoring rare or complex cases.
- **Incomplete metadata:** Missing demographic attributes (age, race, gender) cause inaccurate predictions.

### Fairness Strategies

- **Data diversification:** Ensure training datasets include diverse populations globally.
- **Bias audits:** Apply fairness metrics like demographic parity and equal opportunity.
- **Explainability:** Use SHAP/LIME to interpret model decisions for clinician trust.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Keep experts involved in high-stakes medical decisions.

## Part 3 - Futuristic AI Proposal

### Title: SkySentinel 2030 – AI-Powered Climate Defense System

### Problem Solved

Climate-related disasters like droughts, wildfires, and floods are escalating. Current human interventions are reactive and insufficient. SkySentinel provides **autonomous, proactive climate defense** using AI.

### AI Workflow

- **Data Inputs:**
  - Satellite imagery, drone surveillance, carbon emission sensors, real-time weather data, ocean temperature/salinity.
- **Model Architecture:**
  - Multimodal deep learning, reinforcement learning for decision-making, and time-series forecasting.
- **Autonomous Actions:**
  - Cloud seeding drones, smart CO₂ scrubbers, marine cloud brightening interventions.

### Risks & Benefits

**Benefits:**
- Prevent extreme events and reduce emergency response costs.
- Protect climate-vulnerable communities.
- Promote sustainable environmental stewardship.

**Risks:**
- Unintended ecological side effects.
- Geoengineering could be politicized or misused.
- Global conflicts due to lack of regulatory frameworks.
